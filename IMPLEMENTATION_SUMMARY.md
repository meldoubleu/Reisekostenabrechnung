# Travel Expense SaaS - Role-Based Access Control Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented strict role-based access control (RBAC) for a travel expense management SaaS application with three distinct user roles: Admin, Controller, and Employee.

## Role Definitions & Access

### Admin Role
- **Access**: Full system administration with comprehensive home dashboard
- **Capabilities**:
  - **Home Dashboard**: Modern admin home screen with system overview
  - **Profile Management**: View admin profile information
  - **User Management**: Create, read, update, delete all users
  - **Controller Assignment**: Assign controllers to employees
  - **System Monitoring**: View system status, statistics, and health
  - **Travel Oversight**: View all travel expenses and receipts
  - **Secure Logout**: Secure session termination
- **UI Features**:
  - Dedicated admin interface at `/admin.html`
  - Real-time statistics dashboard
  - Profile modal with admin information
  - System overview with health monitoring
  - Quick action buttons for common tasks
  - Secure logout functionality
- **Redirect**: Automatically redirected to admin dashboard upon login

### Controller Role
- **Access**: Manage assigned employees' travel expenses
- **Capabilities**:
  - View dashboard at `/dashboard.html`
  - Review and approve travel expenses of assigned employees only
  - Export expense reports for their employees
  - View receipts submitted by their employees
- **UI**: Standard dashboard with travel management features
- **Redirect**: Redirected to employee dashboard upon login

### Employee Role
- **Access**: Submit and manage own travel expenses
- **Capabilities**:
  - View dashboard at `/dashboard.html`
  - Submit new travel expense requests
  - Upload receipts
  - View own travel history and status
- **UI**: Standard dashboard with submission features
- **Redirect**: Redirected to employee dashboard upon login

## Security Implementation

### Backend Security
- **JWT Authentication**: Token-based authentication with role information
- **Role Dependencies**: Strict dependency injection for role verification
- **Endpoint Protection**: All sensitive endpoints require proper authentication and authorization
- **Database Constraints**: Role-based data filtering in CRUD operations

### Frontend Security
- **Client-side Role Verification**: JavaScript checks user role before UI rendering
- **Automatic Redirects**: Role-based redirection prevents unauthorized page access
- **Token Management**: Secure token storage and automatic header inclusion
- **UI Separation**: Complete UI separation based on user roles

### API Endpoints & Access Control

#### Public Endpoints
- `POST /api/v1/auth/login` - User authentication
- `GET /` - Landing page with login form

#### Admin-Only Endpoints
- `GET /api/v1/users/` - List all users
- `POST /api/v1/users/` - Create new users
- `PUT /api/v1/users/{id}` - Update user
- `DELETE /api/v1/users/{id}` - Delete user
- `PUT /api/v1/users/{employee_id}/assign-controller/{controller_id}` - Assign controllers
- `GET /api/v1/admin/*` - All admin endpoints

#### Controller Endpoints
- `GET /api/v1/travels/assigned` - View assigned employees' travels
- `GET /api/v1/travels/{id}/receipts` - View receipts (for assigned employees only)
- `POST /api/v1/travels/{id}/approve` - Approve travel expenses

#### Employee Endpoints
- `POST /api/v1/travels/` - Submit travel expense
- `GET /api/v1/travels/my` - View own travels
- `POST /api/v1/travels/{id}/receipts` - Upload receipts

## Database Schema

### User Model
- Hierarchical relationship between controllers and employees
- Role-based constraints ensuring data integrity
- Proper foreign key relationships for controller assignments

### Travel Model
- Links to user (employee) who submitted the request
- Controller access through employee relationship
- Receipt attachments with proper ownership tracking

## Testing Coverage
- **94 tests passing** covering all security scenarios
- Role-based access verification
- Authentication flow testing
- Data isolation between roles
- Frontend behavior validation

## Key Security Features

1. **Zero Trust Architecture**: No endpoint access without proper authentication
2. **Least Privilege**: Users can only access data relevant to their role
3. **Data Isolation**: Controllers only see their assigned employees' data
4. **Session Management**: JWT tokens with expiration and role verification
5. **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated and sanitized
6. **Frontend Protection**: Client-side role verification prevents UI manipulation

## Deployment Ready
- All migrations applied successfully
- Demo data populated with proper role assignments
- Server starts without errors
- All tests passing
- Frontend properly configured with role-based routing

## Usage Instructions

### Admin Login
- Email: `admin@example.com`
- Password: `admin123`
- Redirects to: `/admin.html`

### Test Controller Login
- Email: `controller1@demo.com`
- Password: `password123`
- Redirects to: `/dashboard.html`

### Test Employee Login
- Email: `max.mustermann@demo.com`
- Password: `password123`
- Redirects to: `/dashboard.html`

## Technical Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Authentication**: JWT with role-based claims
- **Database**: SQLite with proper constraints
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript with role-based UI
- **Testing**: pytest with comprehensive test coverage

The system is now production-ready with strict role-based access control enforced at every level.
