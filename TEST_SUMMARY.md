## 🧪 Test Types Implemented

### 1. Model Tests (`test_models.py`)
- Travel model creation and validation
- Receipt model creation and validation  
- DateTime handling and serialization

### 2. API Tests (`test_travel_api.py`, `test_receipt_api.py`)
- Travel CRUD operations
- Receipt upload and management
- Error handling for invalid requests
- PDF export functionality

### 3. OCR Tests (`test_ocr.py`)
- Text extraction from images and PDFs
- Receipt parsing with real and synthetic data
- Error handling for corrupted files
- Multiple file format support

### 4. Integration Tests (`test_integration.py`)
- Complete workflow testing
- Multi-file upload scenarios
- Error handling across endpoints
- List ordering and pagination

## 🚀 Test Infrastructure

### Test Data Management
- **Synthetic receipts**: Generated with realistic content
- **Real receipts**: Downloaded from public sources (with fallbacks)
- **Multiple formats**: PNG, JPEG, PDF support
- **Automatic cleanup**: Temporary files managed properly

### Fixtures & Configuration
- **Async database**: Isolated test database per test
- **HTTP client**: AsyncClient for API testing
- **Sample data**: Realistic travel and receipt data
- **Temporary directories**: Clean upload handling

## 📈 Areas for Further Improvement

### 1. API Coverage (Currently 32%)
The main area for improvement is `api/v1/travels.py`. Currently missing:
- Edge cases in travel creation
- Invalid date range handling
- File upload validation
- Large file handling
- Concurrent upload scenarios
- PDF generation error cases

### 2. Authentication & Authorization
- User role testing (Employee vs Controlling)
- Permission validation
- Session management
- JWT token handling

### 3. Performance Testing
- Large dataset handling
- Concurrent user scenarios
- File upload limits
- Database query optimization

### 4. Frontend Testing
- UI component testing
- Form validation
- File upload progress
- Error message display

## 🛠️ Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
./run_local.sh test

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=backend --cov-report=html

# Run specific test categories
pytest tests/test_models.py -v           # Model tests
pytest tests/test_ocr.py -v              # OCR tests  
pytest tests/test_integration.py -v      # Integration tests

# Run tests in parallel (faster)
pytest -n auto

# Generate detailed coverage report
